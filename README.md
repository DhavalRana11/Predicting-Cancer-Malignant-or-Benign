# Predicting-Cancer-Malignant-or-Benign
 # Project Overview:
   According to the Canters for breast cancer is the most common type of cancer for women regardless of race and ethnicity. Around 927241 women are diagnosed with breast 
   cancer each year. Although we may not be aware of all the factors contributing in developing breast cancer, certain attributes such as family history, age, obesity, 
   alcohol and tobacco use have been identified from research studies on this topic (DeSantis, Ma, Bryan, & Jemal, 2014). Breast images procedures such as mammography have 
   been found to be quite effective in early identification cases of breast cancer (Ball, 2012). When breast images procedures are not utilized, patients can find out late 
   about their diagnosis to be able to treat it. Similar work on attempting to find the best way to predict the type of cancer based on images of mammograms has identified 
   Support Vector Machine as the best predictor after tuning parameters.

# Problem Statement
 This project focuses in investigating the probability of predicting the type of breast cancer (malignant or benign) from the given characteristics of breast mass computed 
 from digitized images. The cases provided, are cases diagnosed with some type of tumor, but only some of them (approximately before 89.4%) are malignant. This project will 
 examine the data available and attempt to predict the possibility that a breast cancer diagnosis is malignant or benign based on the attributes collected from the breast 
 mass. To achieve this goal, the following steps are identified: • Download the breast cancer images data from UCI repository • Familiarize with the data by looking at its 
 shape, the relations between variables, their possible correlations, and other attributes of the dataset. • Pre-process data if needed • Split the data into testing and 
 training samples • Employ Decision trees classifiers, XGBoost classifier to predict the data with different sets of training samples (100, 200, 300, and 400). • Once the 
 best predicting model is identified, will reduce the training set in size to see what is the limit for this classifier to best predict these data. • Compare the best 
 identified classifier with evaluation metric stated at the beginning of the project

# Dataset and Inputs
 The characteristics of the cell nuclei have been captured in the images and a classification methods which uses linear programming to construct a decision line. The dataset 
 is published.

# Predicting-Cancer-Malignant-or-Benign:
# Write conclusions.
•Utilized the Decision Tree Classifier to achieve a 89.4% accuracy in a cancer prediction project, which was further enhanced to 92.3% accuracy by implementing the XGBoost Classifier and cross values score significant increase,highlighting its superior predictive capabilities.

# Improvements
 I think there are possible improvements to be done to the other classifiers that were used to predict this data.I dismissed and continued improving the ones that predicted 
 the best from the very beginning. This is a common approach humans take on many things, but it is possible to modify the other classifiers that did not perform well 
 initially. The information added for the best classifiers, Decision tree Classification and XGBoost classifier.
